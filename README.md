# React + Vite

URL for deployed site

---

Requirements
Your application must meet these requirements to pass (this it your Minimum Viable Product):

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REACT.
Hosted on GitHub pages or Netlify.
Frequent commits to GitHub.
A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:

Explanations of the technologies used.
Explanations of the approach taken.
A link to your live site.
Usage instructions, if relevant.
Unsolved problems.
etc.
Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM.

my plan is to have a home page with different things ABC's, colors, animals, and food when you click it says the word outloud and then after a short delay goes to another page with a carousel of letters/words based on the catagory chosen. Each catagory is a new page and displays the letter/word and image, when the word or image are touched it will play the word sound.

I will add navigation to go back or home(start over).

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
